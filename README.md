Micro to macro scaling in energy and economics 


This repository contain the files (codes, documents, presentations) developed as a part of the micro to macro scaling studies at UT Austin (Energy Institute). 
The study involves micro to macro scaling of energy and economics. The primary approach is building agent-based models where agents follow simples rules in 
consuming energy/resource and take part in a simplistic economy. The initial agent-based models are based on Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY) mdoel. The HANDY
model is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model [1].
The research team at Energy wants to add new features to the HANDY_ABM model to answer questions like how does a distribution of resource in space affects
the size of economy.
